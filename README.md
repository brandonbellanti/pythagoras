# Introduction

pythagoras is an ongoing digital humanities project started by Brandon Bellanti, a masters student in the School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) at Simmons University in Boston, MA. The project was conceptualized as a requirement for the Prague Summer Seminar through the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

The goal of the project is to perform pattern recognition on music scores to identify relationships within individual works, between works by the same composer, and between works from different composers. In it's current form, pythagoras exists as a searchable database of composers and their works.
